I was the first match struck at the first cremation; you are my shallow grave, I'll tend you as a sexton
If you're the casket door that's being slammed upon me I'll be a plague cross painted on your naked body
Well, summer sighed and summoned up hail, dirty in dish rack drips the holy grail
May be heart-slob but I want 'em to know, cut and shut us like a portmanteau
We sit around just spitballing, all the witches cackle 'round my cauldron
Recognise the lies from my poker tongue, is it true?
They say you and me are tautology
What grows from the seeds, can you quite believe? 
Through cracks come the weeds
Long time listener, first time caller; no need to remind me what death leaves behind me
Why must I lie awake from dusk until the morning, through fear of being impaled upon errant mattress spring?
Within a waking dream, I finally made my heel turn. Lived life as Super 8 when you were promised Hilton
Propose me as a pardon for sins, led on barbecue, I'm burnt offerings
I proof-read the Book of Job for the Lord; edit one, League Cup 2004
We, delicate as a filigree, cleared a place for us in the chicory
Colosseum blood will dry in the sun, is it true?
We tread it carefully, we feel around in kid-gloves what death will leave behind, death will leave behind love
We will flower again, I have surely seen it, we will flower again

There's no box to tick for red, so I put down blue instead 'cause it's closest there's to grey in the categories
And the veins within the whites are a statement of demise, doe eyes, you should stay at home licking batteries
And I feel like I'm the host of a terrible game show and the guests on today's quiz are celebrities
Won't respond to any clues, they're just cracking jokes for views, but the answers to these questions mean everything
I had a friend who had made a flag day blood on their hands from shards of a heartbreak
I have known friends to crack from love's weight blossom in ribcage, until their backs break
Oh, it won't get better, that doesn't mean it's gonna get any worse
You're final draft'a life-long love letter signed to the man who will be driving your hearse
Salacia's in the depths, and if I avoid the nets, threaten, "I'll cuckold you Neptune," for definite
Meet between the dog and wolf, with the hoarfrost underfoot and I'll show you every fire in Delphinus
A heart of stone, rind so tough it's crazy: that's why they call me the avocado, baby
May she who casts the first fist of dirt across the casket have mourners lick the mud from her fingernails
'Tween the breadth'a your arms span, I was a renaissance man; books of lies stacked either side, you were my carrell

You say you are an old cassette that has gone and spilt its spool; you're far more like a wet cardboard tube on this nightclub toilet floor
As I describe my lonely, you listen very clear: the last set of goalposts taken down, summer of odd-numbered year
She says, "If you're unhappy, then you gotta find the cure"; well, I prescribe me one more beer, beyond that I am unsure
May not be be all and end all, in my defence, she is the hole; I've thrown my goalkeeper forward, she's catenaccio
Flotsam, Jetsam and Spindrift, all the girls I have loved; dumped to earth by a spendthrift, gilt angels from above
And I saw God in the bathroom, I baptised him in sick, embraced him around his cistern, "C'est la mort, enough of this"
Knees knocking and blood flowing, so, I want you to know
And later she said something that stuck hard in my mind: "We are their Capel Celyn, they gotta keep their slippers dry"
To empathise with Tory's, to invite upon disease, a safer bet's to pack your bags, go holiday in Eyam"
I will take you where the sun shines, cast shadows on your face, crawl into their deepest recess, 'til I freeze or dehydrate
We'll live and breathe it in real time, montage is for the dead, and my heart's still doing Fosburys, nowhere near finished yet
Knees knocking and blood flowing, so, I want you to know that I want to

Now is time to take recourse, to drag my bones from 'neath his corpse, retract the blade within his heart, inscribe our initials in the bark
Of every tree in every woods, in ink red blood, can you imagine? While wearing his head as a hood I'd take life for a crime of passion
Darling, if I had the choice, I'd excavate his throat of voice and corrugate his vocal chords to play a tune to please the Lord
Make him recite this murder ballad, a sombre tune told by a bore, pump blood around the limp and pallid, harmonising as you snored
Lies told...
One day when I'm older, I'll write it all down: a portrait of the trequartista as a young man
We all know we're gonna die, we're a speck of dust in a bad god's eye
He rubs us clean, but love is blind, a balloon artist kisses porcupine

We lined up there pale, stiff and cold, like racks of bed and breakfast toast
So high up on the slate quarry that you swore that you could see the coast
I thought I lost you in the dark, only twenty-four feet apart
More stories tightrope on that stare than the same white line at Meurig Park
The dirt above, the stars below, I watched your face dry cold amid the afterglow
And when they think of you and me, it's clear if you're the doormat, I'm the hickory
Happenstance can wait for tomorrow 'cause you got to do it right
Your shoulders flow from neck like a wine bottle's, bear them broad tonight
You and I, we consecrate my heart and all resolve might break
You'll know us by the way we crawl, you'll know us by our cemetery gaits
Dawn comes, awoken by sheep's bleat, a fleet of hearses line the street
A widow sobs, more widows weep, while we intrude like a widow's peak
I shimmy up the cenotaph, regale with my melancholy
"Two words upon my headstone, please, don't need date or name, just 'Sad Story'"
They boast of poets on their side but what use will they be if this comes to a fight?
I glance along the length of pew and all that I can think's I want to undress you

The clouds salivating, drooling from the sky at the thought of the trouble to wreak
'Til lightning breached their bellies, caesarean section washes pigment from every street
And it's high tide, as the sewers rise and the drains have become obsolete
Seems there's no place in this town for something as pure as you seem
I'm diving into headers, put this pretty face where the boots are flying in
Been bobbing rotten apples, water to my waist in a shark-infested bin
People laugh, they will call it folly, but we connected like a Yeboah volley
I'm totting up my worth in stamps, but doing it in second class
I heard that it hurts, and I said, "Ohhh"
Two wrists, two wrist watches, tick-tick-tocking, second hands slightly out of time
A constant subtle reminder one of us will be gone before bells of the other chime
I requested a room with a view in the middle of a war between me and you
And leave with all the dignity of missed Panenka penalty
And I heard that it hurts, and I said, "I'll be gloomy 'til they glue me in the arms of she who loves me"
She smiled at a joke, but I said, "I'll be gloomy 'til they glue me in the arms of she who loves me"
"'Til the rats and worms are all interned at least 5 feet above we"
Draw me like one of your fence girls, stood erect as a post, head to toe in creosote
We're blocking out all the lapsed-punks, listen them piss and moan, counting out major notes
Banned from every bar in town, snooker balls, a weapon made
Snooker cue held upside down propelled like helicopter blade
The crowds celebrating, drooling from each side with the thought of the trouble to wreak
And you hear them singing in every room, from nursery to tomb, "Ex-boyfriend, give us a song"
"Ex-boyfriend, give us a song, ex-boyfriend, boyfriend, give us a song"

There is no blues that can sound quite as heartfelt as mine
Lamented at the gorge of the river, I watched it weep its banks dry
I hum the sorriest tune on the bar at these dives
Send all the patrons running home to make up with their first wives
(But the low... And to bask...)
My prose is purple but not as pretty as Lucerne
For sweet nothings from the lips of a gargoyle, nobody ever yearned
Perpetually a philistine, but darling, I am longing to learn
Been looked at like the rotten grape on the vine, while you and yours are drinking Sauternes
(But the low) is what I came for
(But the low) is what I came here for
(And to bask) in a darkness I do adore
I do adore, I do adore, I do adore
I am the magpie's solo, the sorrow that makes you salute
Pounding the earth for the early worm, I am a glutton but it's good for my glutes
I was solace to the sirens, the bait on the fisherman's rod
The hook took me far from my family, but closer to God

I was born atop a winter's hill, I took form as a ball in the virgin snow
That started on its slow descent barely more than twenty-seven years ago
And every ounce my love has grown I absorbed another flake
When this avalanche has hit imagine the mess I will make
A tidal wave from the tears, will you toil in the garden to dig a well deep to the core of the earth?
They'll sob enough to douse all the fires of hell
I see you with shovel in hand, your skirt billows above your knees
Envy the soil that fills their pores and this perverted breeze
And I'm full to the brim, pull me up to your mouth, let it spill, let it spill
And I'm full to the brim, flood the North to the South, let it spill, let it spill
And I'm full to the brim, let it spill, let it spill, let it spill all over us two
I take no solace in coastal breezes 'cause the quay is sea minor without you
BÃ©la Guttmann of love, curse all my exes to a life of celibacy
And then while you freed the doves I shot them from the sky for taxidermy
An every day disaster a bread and butter tragedy, I sunk an oil tanker off the shores of Galillee
You'll find me upside down in the belfry 'cause baby, I'm bats, it is true

One last meal as one last gesture, cheapest wine, second-best restaurant
Clapperboard made of two pork chops, credits roll before the scene stops

And in the shower, heard your housemate on the phone
Lathered up my padded bones, lathered up my padded bones, from her soap I foam
The shower-head moaned, and I looked down to the tray
Sons and daughters washed away, sons and daughters washed away, "Good night, God bless," she'd say
The length of your legs, half the length of your body
Above you, thinking of she, above you, thinking of she, I knew I should leave
I said this before and I thought that we agreed
The time before the last, the time before the last, before the last time

As I swan dive into the estuary, the birds do not flinch at my fall
They perch in the rafters, before, during, after, they do not notice me at all
As I float down into the estuary, wind cases my body in cool
I smell petrol fumes, see the smoke rise in plumes, the earth is one big fireball
Anecdote, lie, my own alibi, I've been telling jokes
Piled notes high, my own alibi, I've been selling rope
As I break the film of the estuary the seaweed submerges my form
No passing cars stop, not a single jaw drops
As my wallet and keys sink before, a splash all I left in the world
Once held a magpie in the palm of my hand and the blood in our veins flowed faster, as I'd planned
Got a heart full of love and a head full of more but a fist full of threads from the seams
And I saw a smile in that beak
Oh, I was a bird right then, one day I will be again, I've been telling jokes while selling rope to you
There's no ticker-tape, no pearly gates, no carnival and no parade, just one, one for sorrow

Turn up pissed up, a pariah, uninvited to his alldayer
His new girlfriend works the door there, he does not intend to pay her
Pictured reading Karl Marx beside his parentsâ pool, facing ridicule he bleated
âThat doesnât make me rich, no way, itâs only outdoor and it isnât heatedâ
Renato DallâAra, living off 2008
Renato DallâAra, once up then back down again
All I want tonight is a friend and a fight, say it to my face if it satiates your appetite
Daddy came out of retirement, he took a hobby as a PCSO
Let me level this as an indictment: only a part-time grass, but a full-time asshole
They would play my requests at the guestlistâs behest, any disco all across town
But things change, now Stellaâs a lager and boy she is always downed
14 hands upon the paddle, seven asses sitting side saddle

Don't call it a come-on, in spite of if not because of whatever
If extent of my ambition is a lawn to mow, a charger to tether
Introed at the braggers' amnesty, "the greatest lover in the cloisters"
When the neutrals started cheering me, that is the moment that they lost us
Never once a miser with the misery, clever compromise I replant potted history
You can't eat from spinning plates, can't lick clean the mess it makes
Seen all there is to be shown, darling, I'm coming home
Still flutters pitter-patter, feeling embittered, battered
Behold the once and future me, sad suppers for the saudaddy
Frogmarch through the city, ascend another synthetic summit
Until I see the route crows fly to you, then I will want no part of it
Save your epiphanies for sea level, save them for Broadsands
Save them for throwing out time at Scribes West, save them for chucking up in your own hands

I found a home away from home as I broke up in Amarante, in the Campo do Carvalhal, centre circle every day
Erratic kamikaze I co-piloted the swift, dreamt I'm anchoring that midfield like the anchor in my midriff
I drifted through a month alone as I broke up in Amarante, nursed a two-beer buzz four whole weeks 'cause it's the only way to feel sane
The newspaper front on the counter top emblazoned spot kick miss
I couldn't even hum in your mother tongue, just a thumbs down raspberry kiss
I threw an empty bottle from way up, it thudded into the maw; truth be told, I spent the afternoon and I threw fifteen more
I'm woken by a honking horn, hungover, spread-eagle, strength between the clicking crickets' knees enough to crush my skull
You really can't complain, it's just a holiday, you fill a wall chart out thirty-one days away
It seems unfair to be a rotten horn of plenty, seems unfair to be... (Nah, I'm gonna need you to help me out here)
It seems unfair to be a rotten horn of plenty
It seems unfair to be cadaver for a curse
It seems unfair to be an overflow for empty
It seems unfair to try your best but feel the worst

We felt a chill from the breeze move in from the east, London pat its own back
Those with the means for the megaphone will always provide us the soundtrack
I started to diarise the coming of flies when gloom is descending
So when it's back round again I know it's a false start and not an ending
Some days I struggle to move in elephant shoes, unwilling commuter
Anxiety in my chest, heart under duress, taps out of sharpshooter
Preoccupied now for days, by nostalgia waves, I hated the first time
A gambler's fallacy: The more I repeat, I won't be the punchline
You, on a lilo, are an island of the Pacific; and then me, me, me, I am face down in a puddle on the high street
I got your initials inside a heart tattoo, we two in vermillion, we two a lovers' coup
I know little, but I promise: there's a slow, slow death if you want it
In time I will have to lie, these memories are mine, not in fact my father's
A schoolboy hero replaced, domestic disgrace, a sad scak, a martyr
We here are common as dirt, three lions on our shirt, with high expectations
Absolve this land of a Queen who feasts while we wean a small, hopeless nation
I know little, but I promise: there's a slow, slow death if you want it, yeah I want it

Parent pick up from off the train, empty high street in pouring rain
Funeral for a family pup, teenage pubs all boarded up
Left your home town, for somewhere new; don't be surprised now it's leaving you
Another weekday night alone, the rise of rent, the fall of home
Battery dies on your monthly call: budget cut at your primary school
Another family friend fell sick, gave the fascists a thousand ticks

Five Flucloxacillin rattle in the pit of my purse, among the ones and the twos I never finished a course
Doctor said, "Don't drink on antibiotics"; reply, "It doesn't matter, hangover's always chronic anyway"
A peloton of OAPs cycling up behind me, shouting, "Step up your paces, we've got places to be"
A pile-on of OAPs crashing in my slipstream; I turn, "Shut up your faces, I'm not your domestique"
They say if they had got the victory they'd act with so much more humility
They say if they had got the victory, well, I guess we'll never know
Am I a piggy bank of obsolete currency? An order of merit from country known for tyranny?
Another blister pack pops, but I still feel much the same; thirty-one, and depression is a young man's game
Found a fiver screwed up inside a prescription receipt from the salbutamol (no, a gift from the sertraline)
Hallowed be somnolence brought on by the tramadol; damned be the knowledge that's it, now you have tried 'em all

We fell out bad on the first night, we tried for the third time, over something in-between
By time trains back running off-peak, half-cut in the Gatekeeper, feeling more serene
And all we've got's the need to breed before we rot, when all is spent and all is lost, when all is said and done
In full: just over a fortnight, nude, drenched in the lamp light curtains let in from the street
We lay cross legged on a mattress, no questions about us, she serenaded me
All these sick scenes played out in my memory; wake up, I'll tell you everything honestly
"Hirwain, Minny, Tewkesbury, or Brook Street, what I'd not give just to have another week"
Here's to the fourth time! Call it "The Time Before the Last Time" or "Good News For Her Mother"!

May I have a moment please, before the guillotine, to lament on her wet hair
Tousled over her left shoulder wearing a Corfu t-shirt she took as her nightwear
I could slip on my own salt sobs seeking the cold embrace of the fridge freezer aisle
Catwalk into the dog pound, now with my flesh wounds dressed to spring-summer style
For whom the belly tolls, for who the tap drips dry and the bath water runs cold
For whom the belly tolls, for who all time ticks by until one joke becomes old
There is beauty in the world, I've been told by people I've nothing but trust in
Piled up with the cotton buds, among the toothpicks, inside the dark of the dustbin
Waited outside of "Jersey Boys" for what seemed like a year, a life in the vestibule
Scout yourself as a one-man team, you're a one club man denied a testimonial
No knot in the waistband, persuade me to give up and leave quietly
No reason to grandstand, file me alongside the obscene
It's 7:20 Monday morning, I look to the man with no suit for a warning
If open to reason/collusion, may the way that I go be regrettable, gruesome, in exchange for one thing: "I beg do not take me today"
Babbling, "Please let me stay"

Got Stendhal's bad, it struck me dumb, Venus in steel toes with fake furs in hand
Your doorstep, first place podium, I stood in awe, carrier bag of cans
Two puckered lips and a t-shirt suntan
I assembled former ghosts at a seance, said I missed 'em, you only have to say it once
What I truly fear, maybe selfishly, when I finally rest, someone will summon me
In time a monument will cast two shadows in the middle of a square
Mistold when thousand years have passed, as clima-fit suit, as towelling bridal wear
Four puckered lips and some vows to swear
I don't know, I don't wanna know now
Trusted heart pumps blood around a monolith that lets me down, I don't wanna know, I don't wanna know
At least when we're encased in concrete we'll be safe

A stack of words in my throat, a trail of slime; forehead on fruit machine, three bells will not chime
For lovers who line the beach whom moon entertains, theirs always waxing while our crescent wanes
I'm shouting out a litany, an echo calls back
Outside a chicken shop, a ceiling of stars, a nostril of Diet Coke, I'm back in your arms
I'm shouting out a litany, an echo calls back
Now I feel the misery in your breast and mine is one and the same and I feel close to fine
Your hand is on the pen but you can't sign the pact, I'm shouting out a litany, an echo calls back
Heart swells, ah

They're singing Bread of Heaven but they're baking it with our dough
Living as common criminal, but acting local hero
Wish I'd savoured that awkward little silence that grew up to be a deafening hush
Curling up, cuddling a big red button to push
The students spilling out at the bus stop are forcing me to walk in the street
I move against the tide of the tourists, I am lacking but they're looking replete
He's playing dickhead's advocate and every date's a house show
I'm dropping my defences 'til libido's my libero
And if you're keeping track of the notches, even if he had a four-poster bed
He'd be sleeping on a pile of woodchip, plucking splinters from his head
My vision is fading, it's blurry, there are fingerprints all over the sun
We're glad to be loved but we're lonely and we feel like we're the only ones
I'm hung empty, all night, all afternoon
Hung empty, horse and, not bride and groom
Hung empty, the world spins but we'll barricade the room
Hung empty, hang onto me, and we'll quarantine the gloom
I've been penning odes to continental bottled lager;bring its mouth to my lips: "Oh holy holy, I do not know what I'd do without you"
We kneel at different altars but we all desire the same: for someone else to seize the bow to find a truer aim
We're small steps down a steep slope, exist as living proof: not right to call this old age but it certainly ain't youth no more
This certainly ain't youth
I wanna shrink to a size to be coddled between the cobble stones, for you to grow to a height to drape a shadow over all of us
Oh, would you let me rest in your flesh rolls? Lay my languor in the calm of your shade?
Sink into its dark until I lose my hands in front of my face
Feels like I've been waiting on it nearly all my life, but what if this is it now, what if this is how we die?

By your hand is the only end I foresee, I have been dreaming you've been dreaming about me
I was sitting on my hands at the top-deck of the 178, spitting cusses at my face reflected in the windscreen pane
Throwing insults and calling names, filthy SMS that you sent through the day
By sundown, become tame, so I set it in motion again
But Fate's a cruel mistress, girl, the prettiest in the world, she dresses loosely in a bathrobe with her hair up in curls
Cause we were kissing for hours with her hands in my trousers, she could not contain herself, suggests we go back to her house
But here it comes, this is the crux, she vomits down my rental tux, I'm not sure if it's love anymore
But I've been thinking of you fondly for sure, remember what your heart is for
And it's a good night for a fist fight
Because the dew will temper your fall, you'll sing me lullabies in form of your cat-calls
And I've been dangling in limbo, barely keeping my cool, it's like I'm snookered between the back cushion and touching the 8 ball
I keep replaying my turn, until your patience is shot, you peel your white gloves off seductively before you re-spot
Your fingertips leave marks and graze, I lay you down atop the baize, I'm not sure if it's love anymore
Graceful, gracious companion with your eyes of doe and thighs of stallion
My gracious companion with your eyes of doe and thighs of stallion

You do not like us 'cause your girlfriend likely does, and all your friends agree on her soft spot for me
I'll have my hard hands over her soft spots soon, you will see
And if you want a list of all her favourite bits, the next time I am free, quite comprehensively
I will scrawl them all down for you as an apology
Tell her the times we shared that broke have been repaired, cinders of our old jokes have once again been stoked
But with a different girl, funnier now they've been rehearsed
All night hung on your every word 'til we were interrupted by the birds singing "Oh, your mask is slipping, oh, your mask is slipping."
Songs I've written about your girlfriend are just psalms of spite since it came to an end
Cause I never made her smile like that and she never made me smile right back
Although I always made her purr like a cat she said I never made her smile like that
She stubbed her home club's crest on me with cigarettes, a swift that matched the bird upon her football shirt
She would lift the hem, she would wear that thing like a skirt
The last time I was there she let me wear her clothes
She painted my lips red so that we both ensured I kiss her every inch, my god the girl looked like she'd burned
All these songs I've written about your girlfriend are just killing time while my heart is on the mend

A wishbone hangs between your breasts, I hope you haven't pulled it yet
And if this little finger doesn't have the strength then I'm scared that this bird's back bone breaks
It's only hope that springs eternal, and that's the reason why this dripping from my broken heart is never running dry
I wear a ring of your lipstick around the knuckle of my 4th digit; it reminds me what our bodies sowed, it will do until we are betrothed
The space between your navel and your waistband was the ice where two fingers pirouette, but now these hang nails they just slice
Your tongue, the tide, your lips, the shore, I am the jetsam overboard, goodbye courage
I christen all the ships that sailed on your little kisses' saliva trails, goodbye courage, hello sadness again
Little kisses come to pass, then
Goodbye courage, hello sadness
Now with those four fingers gone you leave me only with my thumb, that constantly is pointing down the emperor bears teeth not frown

My brown eyes, two pools of mud
Resting in two dark moons, they turn the tide into a flood
And the bloodshot lines in the whites map every A road in this town
All the glare of the city lights, every cul-de-sac we've talked down
Over time they build up the city and our arguments show it all
Every ring road, every motorway displayed in crease and wrinkle
Until my face is a map you have folded up one hundred, one thousand times
You know it starts pretty rough, and ends up even worse
And what goes on in-between, I try to keep it out of my thoughts
Your blue eyes qre like the deepest and warmest seas
As the salt elevates my body they float my heart up past my teeth
And with the water and the Cypriot sun
Would your psoriasis bleach and be gone? Would it fix the pallor of my skin? Would my freckles all meld into one?
Your body above me, sobbing down, my cheeks wet from your tears
They extinguish each of the burning thread veins, flow down to my ears
Now they rest in two tiny reservoirs that overfed the wedded canals
And life, life is a long time, too long to my mind, too long by far
Between my waterfalls and your landslides there's cartography in every scar
Life, life is a long time, too long to my mind, too long by far
Because it starts pretty rough and ends up even worse

I am not a crutch, although my knees are rife with woodworm
And the mealworms I misheard for lunch are rotting in my guts
With a childhood of fingernails that ripped my throat to shreds
A walk that chimes like church bells from all these loose joints in my legs
These three lions that were sitting on my chest are clawing hard into my skin as I am gasping for my breath
And as they each play noughts and crosses on the scratches they have left I have to screw up both my eyes as it goes into sudden death
They whisper "Really all these noughts are circles holed, bereft and all these crosses crucifixes spreading guilt and sense of dread."
And as we stumbled homeward up the hill to where you used to live, the cold makes ice upon our cheeks from all the tears that we have shed
These things rattle round my head, if he hasn't blown the whistle then it isn't quite the end
Every defeat a divorce; although I look surprised, it's par for the course I guess
And I don't really know now, what I thought I knew then
You can lead a horse to water but it won't drown itself
This one family photograph always floats to the top
Like a beaming, bloated corpse though having been made up
My memories are sepia but the photograph is not
An historian is fucking with them as deadly as garrotte
Where they're standing in the kitchen with his arms around her waist
With no idea of what's to come and with a smile across your face
And all the fittings are the same but every other thing has changed
Must forget everything you know as though your mouth and tongue estranged
Small comforts found in ABBA Gold and electronic chess
When West Clewes was my Waterloo, my most dramatic test
Now I've been walking down the shortcuts and the alleys in the dark
Because I'm not scared of the shadows, they're no blacker than my heart
But how could I ever refuse, I feel like I lose when I lose

Recall the time we straddled your windowpane
Smoked the last of the weed that sent you insane
In a public loo in a borough of London that I won't mention
You phoned me in Minnesota, said you had a vital question
And as we smoked you feared you neighbours might see
We watched a fox rip out the contents of each bin bag that lined the road
And then you turned to see me mouth "Those entrails are how I'll feel when you decide to leave me."
Now I've a whole lot of hate for the island, since your friends buried you down there six feet deep beneath the sand
But at least I know we'll never be that far now from each other, just a couple hundred feet either side of sea level
It's no lie if the waters rose and drowned that place from coast to coast, you wouldn't see this smile leave my face for all eternity

The black bird sits atop my guts and spreads its wings for flight
My shoulders back, my jaw pushed out, my stomach sucked in
Its wingtips push across my lungs and fill them full of feathers
But the brushstrokes feel like hearthpokes into my skin
The black bird feasts upon my guts and bears its beak to fight
Now they poke between my teeth and that's why I thirst
When he flies me to the top there's nothing but the fog
A heart of stone, eggshells for bones, they lead you to be lost
The dark slope drags you down, the dark slope drags you down
The black bird is a part of me, a part of me, so sad to see
The black bird is a part of me, so sad, to see, so sad
I ask before I go for you to drop a lit match down my throat and smoke the bastard out or burn him to a crisp
Cause I'm already carrion, been eaten from the inside too long
This black bird wants to rip me limb from limb
The black bird dips its beak in blood and writes its thoughts in cursive 'cross the bones that are its jailer and my ribcage
And when you turn me inside out, believe in me, without a doubt, the words were all of his and none of mine
The black bird is a part of me, so sad, to see, so sad to be me

Meet me at St. Nicholas, among the oaks behind the church
That sway like pig-tailed girls as summer wind whistles, around your bare-skin knees and the forsythia leaves
In the shade, lay with me, tickled by the feather reed
That's where the trees grow old, under the ivy's hold, as you in my two arms, equally safe from harm
And in a hazy daydream, our bodies married the stream and we broke down into pebbles and silt
The water ran from the fields until the oceans were filled and found the seabed the comfiest quilt
There was more life in the weeds than in the few hundred seats in rows from transept to chancel to nave
And when their anger had paused, I turned and answered their calls with "You're just audience, I'm the applause"
We take on the burden of all these sad-eyed children with lilies bunched in our hands
We fake our concern and speak softly as the surgeon tells wife to cancel her plans
Take a body to water, take a body to tundra, just take me with you as well

We burnt all the skin from the palm of my hands with an old zippo lighter and deodorant can
I went to the palmist and asked her to read: no heart line, no sun line, no life line, no need
Said all that I wanted was a quiet life, not one predetermined by minuscule slices into my flesh and the broad she agreed
One look in my sad eyes, she had to concede
Baby, the girdle of Venus got me, got me down on my knees
And baby, baby I got the death rattle and you're six months old s-shakin' me
Traced my right index finger 'long the roof of every car
On the walk back to your house in the cold from City Arms
In the frost I drew a dick for every girl that wouldn't fuck me
Woke early the next morning to see the frost had bitten me
My blisters black and touch cold, like a cute stuffed toy bear's nose
The kind of gift I'd give you, like a less committed Van Gogh
And you, you are an angel, that's why you pray, and I am an ass, that's why I bray
Your halo slipped to frame you like a photo, a porthole window
I see blood spill in the pure snow, you see sweet sauce on ice-cream cones
If you were tomorrow, I'd be today, and this is the endâ¦
I'm serious, so listen: baby I got the death rattle, and baby I got it bad
I've been digging my grave for quite some time when I'm not digging up the past
And I chewed my only necktie from the metal frame of my bed
Where I tied your wrists together, spent all night givin' (oh, you get the message, though)
Not headstone, but headboard's where I want to be mourned

I part the curtains of your hair and all the light of the sun floods the room poured from your sleepy stare
Two seconds each morning without fail before I enter the abattoir to see my insides hanging there
But they request that I leave cause my sad eyes are too much to bear
When the light leaves, the dark sees
Your hands to your hips now, two swan necks, curl between pelvis with stretch marks and shoulders with those freckle flecks
The pain of the silence before bed, oh for the sound of your pissing through the thin walls or stroking your head
But for the shadows and doom and the sorrow we seem to have bred

But let's talk about you for a minute with the vomit in your gullet
From a half bottle of vodka that we'd stolen from the optic
On the back seat in your car because it wasn't safe to start it
You were "far too fucked to drive", were the words that you imparted
And the woollen dress that clung so tight to the contours of your body
And the dead grass stuck to fibres from us rolling in the lay-by
Were passed to dog-haired blankets that protected the bench seat covers
And a crucifix was hung from rear-view mirror by your mother
I'm leaving my body to science, not medical but physics
Drag my corpse through the airport and lay me limp on the left wing
Drop me at the highest point and trace a line around the dent I leave in the ground
That'll be the initial of the one you'll marry now I'm not around
I flew for seven hours, the sky didn't once turn black
You know Iâd sooner go down in a ball of flames than I would lay here and be bored to death
Allâs well that ends
I wake from sleep, my head and shoulders wet against the window
A frost had formed and melted, soaked me right through to my collar bone
If you were given the option of dying painlessly in peace at forty-five, but with a lover at your side, after a full and happy life
Is this something that would interest you? Would this interest you at all?

You glug and you glug salt water from sandcastle bucket
You glug and you glug, and the tide turns in your stomach, splash your shoes
You complain the tap water runs solid white
You dangle fishing line for crabs, but they're not interested, I'm your only bite
I watched your face move in a compact mirror, how the powder settles in
Premature crows feet, caused by worry, you say I circle you unwanted like a seagull swoops and feeds from bin
There are listed buildings, and woe betide your listed heart
I think I'd do it for love, if it were not for the money; I'll take any scraps that you can give
Come what midnight, you commandeer a fishing boat, decree to drift further than we could swim
Come what midnight, the neon signs have been unplugged and fade
You danced a jig down at the harbour, create your own flash show with security lights
I remember being naked to my waist, though not in which direction
You are a glutton for love, can you give me some romance? I'm a glutton for sin
We are but two atheists in lust, you know, we gotta make our own luck

Darling, I'm with St. Bernards and we are scouring the Alps and the Andes
And if they die then it is on my head, they follow paw prints in the snow to my throne, to my bed
You're pouting in your sleep, I'm waking still yawning, we're proving to each other that romance is boring
Sure there are things I could do if I was half prepared to prove to each other that romance is boring
Start as you mean to continue, complacent and self-involved
You're trying not to be nervous, if you were trying at all
I will wake, I will bake phallic cake, take your diffidence, make it my clubhouse
But my strength's within lies, ventricle cauterised, it's the way of living that I espouse
We are two ships that pass in the night, you and I, we are nothing alike
I am a pleasure cruise, you are gone out to trawl, return nets empty, nothing at all

On the dashboard assembled in descending height order, half a decade of Father's Day gifts her mother bought for her
Never passed on, puffy eyes, nasty reaction, doe eyes, you're kidding yourself
I learned remedial Spanish from a toddler, passenger seat of father's taxi, cussing in unison
Clutching receipts and deceased handwriting filled with a sense of great disappointment
Doe eyes, you're kidding yourself
And so fucking on, and so fucking forth, we've got your back, whatever that's worth
If your hero told you to go huff a Sharpie, what would you do? (I do not know)
Every girl I ever kissed I was thinking of a pro footballer, thought you should know
I've learned more from toilet walls than I've learned from these words of yours
Your feelings are buried in scriptures and fictions, it's all in the words, but I'm here for the pictures
I'm sweating off the cheat notes on my thighs, they were for your benefit not mine
If we didn't know the shape was for functionality, what would we do? (I do not know)
If it wasn't for the corrupt U.S. pharmacy, what would we do?
Sometimes only you'll know, we're cementing old friends, dismissing old foes, we're throwing punches and ducking blows

Just like when we were seventeen, we said we'd move to Malta, claim nationality
And now that we are twenty-three, days tethered to the running track, evenings chained to the dish rack
I'm called up to the Maltese national team, my vision is impeccable, my first touch is obscene
A World Cup qualifier finds me fifty, forty, thirty yards from goal, a late sub on in an off-the-striker role
Was it wind? Did it take a bad deflection? A decade spent nursing a fear that you might never make it?
The crowd draws breath at once, it swerves to the top corner, the Sunday tabloid press declares me the new king of Malta
With my name on shirts, your face on the cash that every week just piles inside our bank account
We'd rule the roost and we could start a family, I think we'd make about a hundred million bucks
I head down to the mint and tell them, "Pound every coin deep into the ground, burn every note in circulation"
"There's a new face on the currency of our nation"
I hand them a photograph of you, the most beautiful thing they'd ever seen
The press starts a-rolling your image on Euros, the workforce retires to the bathroom

*200-102 plays*

I think we need more post-coital and less post-rock; feels like the build-up takes forever, but you never get me off
You pull your dress over your face and I stare down towards my chest, chastise both our greasy hair, wonder whose gut is the softest
Stand with my ear to the door, listening to the landing floorboards, working out when we'll be safe to dash from mattress to your bathroom
Where I ball my fingers into fists until my knuckles glow bright white, press the heels into eye-sockets 'til I see the flashing lights
Stop me when my stories change, when they have started to repeat 'cause last time I was a mess of sleep, of icy feet
So baby, all apologies, it was going to happen inevitably
I think we need more post-coital and less post-rock; feels like the build-up takes forever, but you never touch my cock
And what exactly do you mean now by, "What can you even eat?" And how does that affect how I'll get off this evening?
I flew down south to Mexico, had a minor realisation: I understood why kids draw the sun with its rays emanating
And the beams broke the clouds, the sky looked like a concertina I'd sat on in my pocket for weeks, folded up from a picture
I've been playing straight chicken with gay girls, it's never enough; she keeps on pulling the peace sign and it seems like a taunt
She licked a glaze on her lips, they shone like Battleship Grey, she never liked the wisdom I gave
"Some people give themselves to religion, some people give themselves to a cause" 
"Some people give themselves to a lover, I have to give myself to goals"
And if it helps, I mean, even slightly at all, it's best to dust yourself down and get straight back on the horse
I condescend a smile and wink directly at the camera, I leave you led in both our scents as I tiptoe out the backdoor
I skid down icy streets and view my face in the reflection of a High Street lingerie store though it wasn't my intention
I phone my friends and family to gather round the television: the talking heads count down the most heart-wrenching breakups of all time
Imagine the great sense of waste, the indignity, the embarrassment when not a single one of that whole century was mine

She turned her back on the church and put all her faith in me
At the back of the chapel where I taught her to screw and to blaspheme
We turned our backs to the church, with our trousers around our knees
While screaming the scriptures she said I was her favourite heresy
In a note I read, "If you should go blind and deaf I'll cleanse and I'll bathe you and I'll cook for you daily"
"I will take a dry ballpoint pen and trace on your chest all of the same conversations that we have now in bed"
I don't mean to be selfish, but I think I'd sooner just be dead
Behind the tennis court alongside the river, not a single live flower to see
This is the one girl who woke up from all that and now falls asleep next to me
But I swear now, every time that I kiss her, she feels her god breathe on her shoulder
It pains me, but I'm sure she's still yours
She said she wanted a sea burial, not grass and hypodermics to her hips
I pruned the ivy from your grandmother's tomb, more tender and careful than the superstitious ripped you from your mother's womb
In a note I wrote, "I think too much about the end but being around it made me feel like I'm coping"
"Now when I view the cemetery I don't see headstones I see rows of engraved middle teeth, hungry, waiting for me"
And though I am fearful, I think I just crave the relief

He grows out his stubble just so that he can scratch at the sunburn, the colour of my arm
Civilians read bibles behind glass windows, is this what constitutes normal behaviour?
Got soul, got vision, got mind to leave here
You soon made an enemy of me; I warned you, don't make an enemy of me
I'll take your heart with such little commotion, by crippling disease or with deadly love potion
I'll bind you and gag you and all's well that ends, I suppose
Got a call, are we not interesting? Fair to say we are not interesting at all
Broke down laughing and screaming for more, but if this changed your life, did you have one before?
And what have we got that is of any use? Allegiance to team that we cannot pronounce
Image seared, dermis spread across tiled floor, a taste on the tongue that you and me both abhor

By now it's just the three of us: me, your shadow, your echo. I do not believe that I've ever felt any more alone.

First and foremost, don't let it be said: I am writing this at 7:10 am
On the hard dry tarmac of a vacant forecourt, astronomically speaking, it's the first day of autumn
But the sun is hanging 'round like summer's hungover, they'll knock the garage down and build flats where I sit
The traffic's so persistent that it barely registers and it smells like a mix between petrol and dog shit
Just let me be the one that keeps track of the moles on your back; I just sighed, the universe replied, "Let this pass you by"
Sometimes it's just enough to know I keep him on his toes
Is he as sympathetic as me to the untimely demise of your synthetic clothes?
I've displayed marriage proposals on the Jumbotrons of ballgames you've not been at
I've written eulogies in guestbooks of galleries in the hope that you might pass
She, nervous and barefoot, chats to me at the front door; he, boyfriend, inside's a saint, becoming a martyr
Me rolling, writhing on the floor, stared daggers pulled from my thoracic wall
When I hold sea shells to my ears, I'm pretty sure I can hear you
He gave a gift of the Faber Book of Love Poems, annotated the ones he thought applied the most
Not gonna win you round with prose, if anyone should know then it's I should know 
Girl, there must be a reason you let it slip, went to the point of sending the message
Six months of visceral Catherine Wheels, kissing carnivores to make it seem like less of a deal
I promise after this I will pick up the phone book and choose the name that my eyes fall upon on their first look
Aim all of my poorly composed declarations there in the future
I'm so sorry to have to put you through a lifetime of dedications that you never desired
And this one sentence bludgeons me over the head
Okay; I'm a little bit drunk, and I mean just a little bit
No lush in denial, only rather coquettish
I'm fifteen years old and my parents' only son
Like I barely survived a girls' school education
Prettier now that you've grown your hair long
I'm a slip of a man since I cut mine all off
Please just let me be the one to keep track of the freckles and the moles on your back

She'd a bruise so black they watched it fade through the full spectrum of colours
They kept it like a pet, a private joke they told no others
And oh, how the tissue repaired and how it turned to yellow
And she found it disgusting, 'cause it didn't match her clothing
He said that it's not yellow, it's golden
Walk out onto your front lawn and face into the rain; shout into the wind, this'll never be the same
They promised they'd be best of friends from now until forever, but both were far too needy not to fall for the other
And how the frequent public displays of sisterly affection, they left her feeling safe, left him with an erection
Her body barely visible, as bleach-white as the bedsheets, as stiff as starched, only perceptible as her middle was still branded
With a heat rash in the perfect shape of the Show-Me State
Your come-on lines sound disastrous, noise more foreboding than volcano or earthquake
Letter from me to Charlotte: "They appropriated everything we ever loved and dressed it up in quotations and fluff"
"And I had a dream, though said with hands in pocket, I mean it hand on heart, you held a gun to his head"
"Pressed your thumbs to her throat", in these letters, letters from me to Charlotte
Things will never be the same again

I grabbed hold of her wrist and my hand closed from tip to tip; I said, "You've taken the diet too far, you have got to let it slip"
But she's not eating again, she's not eating again, she's not eating again, she's not eating again
I ask her to speak French and then I need her to translate, I get the feeling she makes the meaning more significant
She was always far too pretty for me to believe in a single word she said, believe a word she said
At fourteen her mother died in a routine operation from an allergic reaction to a general anaesthetic
Spent the rest of her teens experimenting with prescriptions In a futile attempt to know more than the doctors
She said one day to leave her, sand up to her shoulders Waiting for the tide to drag her to the ocean, to another sea's shore
This thing hurts like hell, but what did you expect?
And all you can hear is the sound of your own heart, and all you can feel is your lungs flood and the blood course
But oh, I can see five hundred years dead set ahead of me, five hundred behind, a thousand years in perfect symmetry
Best known left wrist, right finger through all the Southern states, on every video games machine they call her triple-A
There were racists on the radio trying to give up smoking; the chat show host, he joked, "You have to wait for the government program"
Talk about your politics and I wonder if you could be one of them
But you could never kiss a Tory boy without wanting to cut off your tongue again
A good place to look to the future is when you are sat at the sea with the salt up to your ankles and a view of the end of the pier
You may look down at your model's feet and wish that youâd just float away
And the weather here is overcast and the sea is the same shade of grey
So the landscape before you looks just like the edge of the world
But to the left side and the right side, either way is a crazy golf course
The sea is a good place to think of (to think about) the future
A thousand years, no getting rid of me, a thousand years in perfect symmetry

Can we all please just calm the fuck down?
In an analogy that makes sense to most, this opportunity, it found me unmarked at the far post
But I blazed it right against the crossbar of the pub that you had worked in since you moved here from Bath spa
We agreed we couldn't trust the guy that didn't like a single sport but those bow-legged suitors hadn't given me much of a thought
They said it smelled delicious, but it smelt of burning flesh
Not meant to be malicious but this is the cross we bear
The story of the winter I forgot how to speak: my mind was like a nation's flag, but my breeze was too weak
How they dragged me to the hospital saying I had gone deaf, but I heard everything they said, it's just I had no interest
Our friends have put the two of us on suicide watch and every second spent away we spend watching the clock
There are photos of us holding hands outside of the frame; I was there, but wonder where our fingers were all the same
It's like our self-restraint it's the size of a fingernail
And then we chew it down, yeah, we chew it down all the same
Sad eyes for sad goodbyes, it's a crime, it's a crime, it's a crime, it's a crime

Run the water 'til it scalds, you know that I'm listening
Pitter-patter runs the shower, hits the bare porcelain
Watch the dirt run down the plughole, hear an echo within
They described you nude in detail, I knew everything
An artist's impression of the Manhattan skyline
And a soon-to-be burn scar in the perfect shape of the Sooner State
I fall to my knees, my piss-soaked jeans
The first time, the last time, all the times in between
The first time, the last time, all the times I would've liked there to have been
I can't believe I chose the mountains every time you chose the sea

I think it's fair to say that I chose hopelessness, and inflicted it on the rest of us
But at least I've come to terms with my own mortality
We search for different ways to make it through the wall
Resign our parents' interests will one day be our own
We wait at ease, we wait to see, we are waiting here for catastrophe
The guy singing all the sad songs died, oh well, I guess he was right, oh, I guess he was right
We learn together over time that tolerance is more appealing in theory than in practice
I identify my star sign by asking which is least compatible with yours
And a room full of vacuum and a room full of air look the same
You have not been reborn, you've just painted your face, painted the walls
Message sent to so far unreached peoples, I think they've got it in for us ,I think they've got it in for us
How you break the rules that you yourself imposed
Think you've got it in for us, I think you've got it in for yourselves


Your hands will remain empty when you have stopped clutching at straws
Cling to bad memories, forget all the insufferable bores
No one matters (no one matters), no one cares
He whispered, "Oh my God, this really is a joy to behold"
I thought he said, "It's a joy to be held," so I held him too close
It was a grave mistake, he never came back again
I'm not saying there's good in none of this, miserabilia to show the kids
I'm not saying that you're responsible, miserabilia for one, for all
I've spent too much time on my knees next to urinals in garish Mexican restaurants
Sobbing into my warm, pale palms for a better understanding of my dietary requirements
I've cried on ashen floors of working men's clubs, '96, '98, 2000, 2002, 2004, oh my God, will it end? Oh my God, oh my God!
We got nostalgic, ended up filling shoe boxes with vomit
Collected scabs in lockets, hung them round our necks like nooses
None of it mattered (none of it matters), nobody cared
I have broken down into the naked breasts of a newly ex
No dignity, I can only guess that she thinks about it when she touches herself
Shout at the world, because the world doesn't love you; lower yourself, because you know that you'll have to

By the light of the LED display of a VCR recorder, you kiss my neck, I whisper in your ear, "This is my downfall"
As you squint and you grimace we both know your heart's not in it
By the glow of a thousand fireflies in a Travelodge ensuite, they think the future's bright as halogen, we know it's pretty bleak
And I'm trying to be sexy biting at the air that falls in front of me
Your telegrams are more and more less detailed by the day, and all the characters are strangers and the pubs have different names
I tell a joke that I'd like to meet them but they loathe me and I hate them back
Absence makes the heart grow fonder, fondness makes the absence longer, length loses my interest, I'm a realist, I'm insatiable
Swapped counting days until I fly with hours before your reply
You said he got his teeth fixed, I'm gonna break them, I've got a heart on fire
He said he's got his sights set on getting to you, I've got a fist on fire
You feel terrified at the thought of being left behind, of losing everybody, the necessity of dying
Oh, we kid ourselves there's future in the fucking, but there is no fucking future
I'm just practicing my accents, picking at old sutures
I taught myself the only way to vaguely get along in love is to like the other slightly less than you get in return
I keep feeling like I'm being undercut
Charlotte says, "It's more constructive than the one in Canada when you got drunk, ate loads of crisps and threw up by a football pitch"
I know it is and really that's what worries me, I feel like I should hurt
I cannot emphasis enough that my body is a badly designed, poorly put-together vessel
Harbouring these diminishing, so-called vital organs, I hope my heart goes first, I hope my heart goes first
We are beautiful, we are doomed

*Between an Erupting Earth and an Exploding Sky plays*

I can taste the blood on your lips and on your tongue, I can see your teeth turn pink, your gums fade to white
The less and less I eat, the more you see my teeth
The closer they move together, fill the gaps, curse the weather
Rip the flesh from your bones, wipe me down, drive me home, dump me side of the road if I'm too annoying
Wear your best suit, all these people are watching
Oh baby, you'll need all those fingers for crossing
I'm sucking your last words from the back of your throat
So perfect, so bitter, we laugh, then we choke
You worry a million raindrops'll die with their last memory of you and I
In a soft porn version of the end of the world I quake at the knees as my intentions unfurl
You wrote a letter to God, "Just in case", you said, "I'm nothing if I'm not a pragmatist" 
"You needn't worry about us, we can look after ourselves, we have learnt not to rely on you or anyone else"

This one time I kissed a girl for class war I pulled her hips in close and held my left fist high above her pale right clavicle and she said
"Oh tell me darling, do you think we have a future?" "Well maybe, kind of, pretty sure we've two between us"
"Bring over pictures of your dead pets and relatives and we'll just say it's over if I don't shed any tears"
I'm calling you again on your telephone and all I ever get is another stupid ring tone
He's gonna get drunk and call you at four in the morning (I know!)
He's gonna get drunk and call you at four in the morning
As if I walked into the room to see my ex-girlfriend who, by the way, I'm still in love with, sucking the face of some pretty boy
With my favourite band's most popular song in the background, is it wrong that I can't decide which bothers me most?
In the forefront of my mind it's the thought, not of you underneath, but of me coming out looking worse
I'm calling you again on your telephone and all I ever get is another stupid busy tone

On considering religion or military conscription is the moment I realise I am stuck
Asserting ourselves at traffic lights in foreign countries in the very dead of night is the moment I realise I'm stuck
Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, this is the end of the asterisk
Babe, that punk's got nothing on me, this is the end of the footnote
Extorting money from your parents, your disgusting parents
Honestly, you're an absolute waste of time, craving attention with your self-deprecation
I'll tell you one thing, it's spot on and I'm better
Honestly, you are an absolute tragedy, not like heroically in all of the books you read
I read your novella, oh, how I laughed, killed off the lot of them

I restored your mother's faith in men whilst boring you to death, left nothing more than the circle of stubble rash around your chest
My life was saved by a packet of nineteen cigarettes carried in my left breast pocket for a closest friend
A sleeping bag on the floor twists hips like buffalo horns they said, "That boy's too lazy", you were clearly forewarned
A jealous ex silenced the room, he said that you were a whore, "Do you kiss your mummy's lips with that mouth?"
She imagined everything I said in falsetto, the only way to justify my childish despair
I spent my last six-fifty in a public phone box, graffitied genitalia from the ceiling to the floor
Play reckless, rapid like a fruit machine, I see gargoyles in the floral of the duvet cover
You see melodrama move from one sentence to the other, and many years practice of speaking in hushed tones

Black holes, unraised moles, let's just call them freckles
Haircuts, heart left, happy on the West coast
Coat fell, heart swells, draped across the sofa
Sleep well, I feel you've ruined me forever
I don't want to sound trite but you were perfect, the way you look could seriously make nature dysmorphic
I wish that you would kiss me 'til the point of paralysis
The way I flail my arms in front of you, it just embarrasses
I'll never turn my body clock back and think about the things I'm glad I left out, some things are best left unsaid
Some things are best left unsaid

Word is you slept in a weird position and your back and your shoulders are aching
I say my stomach is chewing its way out from the inside 'cause I've gone three days now without eating
I died on a cross trainer, getting in shape for you
I fell at the first hurdle, you tell me I always do
You asked if I'd be anyone from history, fact or fiction, dead or alive; I said, "I'd be Tony Cascarino, circa 1995"
We're feeling so much more content knowing where our allegiances lie since our kayfabe friends have upped and left you and I
The time we spent around each other's waist, the time spent expressing my distaste
With my eyes on a lightbulb, I choose to keep your birthday present for myself, blow candles, your ill health
I'm being paid thirty-five pounds an hour as a specialist foot fetish model
Flatter my arches, I pirouette for them, I pick the angles, hide my ingrown toenail
You think you're the needle that drains the blood donation, you're just a repetition on an old, worn out pin cushion
As the bus pulls away, I stare at the last field, before we hit the city, that emotional minefield
I seduced your ex-boyfriend to help you get over him, you found him more attractive, it helped you get over me
In the shower, I chew the soap bar from the plastic, the morning after
I love the look of empathy in your eyes, I love the look of lust between your thighs

Broken down like a war economy, father, FÃ¼hrer, don't be mad at me
Peasant child, you're into botany, splitting necks and calling it dichotomy
"Beware", the sign on the door suggests, I'm better off with artificial intelligence
I invented you, I invented you, and I will destroy you
If you catch me with my hands in the till I promise, sugar, I wasn't trying to steal
I'm just swimming in copper to smell and pretend like a robot
And if a leopard doesn't change its spots, you can't change my perceptions just from dots to dots
I'll swap the bruising for a bumping sensation, I'll be Ctrl-Alt-Deleting your face with no reservations
And we'll stop fighting once your circuit board's ignited, singing, "I'm not finished, I'm not finished, no"
Mistaking cables for veins can be quite misleading, friction sparks from metal, made it look like bleeding

Any more tears for the birthing pool? Bear this child directly into misery
Kiss him in the face with no lips and no tongue, but with your little, middle, index and ring fingers
Singing, "I see songs in shapes and colours, not nuclear physics or pottery ovens"
"Fluid lines that soar like towers, patterns reformed just like child actors"
Plunge your hand, rip out my spine, replace it with a UV light
So I can be the beacon of hope that you'd always expected
These constant broken heartbeats sound like breakbeats looping round and round to me
You know he's so much more like Spiderman than you will ever, ever be
So stick with your instincts, stick with the imprints, with the hieroglyphics that the fan club sent us
And roll with the toppers, the slow steady choppers, bat with your eyelids and lose it with your stutter
Go ba-ba-ba-la-ba-ba-ba-da-ba, ba-ba-ba-la-ba-ba-ba-da-ba, honey
I'm taking far too many chances on these less than idealistic romances

We know that we could sell your magazines if only you would give your life to literature, just don't read Jane Eyre
Work on your algebra and stand out in the rain and give yourself to simple pleasures but never play card games
Meanwhile, back at home, not in communist Russia, well, only on my headphones
We plot our march onto the town hall and if we'd take prisoners or simply simper at those fools
Please don't tell me to do the math
Tonight we're gonna smash this place up
And then we're gonna deck it out with fairy lights 'til we are content
And then we'll maybe drown in Dewey decimals but leave our shoes outside the door 'cause that was the point
All of us at home with the moon, pouring through the curtains, working on our attitude
Towards the second-hand book shop employees, rading the inscriptions that were never meant for their eyes
I'm stitching up each one of your pockets so when we are together, you'll maybe look a little less bored
I'm sticking your fingers into sockets to kickstart your little heart and maybe sleep a tiny bit more
Oh, maybe we should read more into the books that we adore, perhaps we should drink less Vitamin C
And now I'm shouting out in capital letters, "I will throw you high-fives if you keep your own secrets"

You expected my war diaries, but time ran out and I, I let you down
A small thanks note written in French is no shorthand for, "This thing gave me writer's cramp"
Another dream about shapeshifting, well, we move with such elegance, with such grace
With all our dignity just in place
Deer die with their eyes wide open, eyes wide open, eyes wide open
Deer die with their eyes wide open
Drawing tiny little pictures of skeletons to get across the sense of impending doom
And the leaves like the artwork to Major Leagues look like dead foxes on the hard shoulder
And for some reason I think that I attributed this story to the bypass of the town I hadn't visited
So goes the backing track of all the sighs we'd ever sighed
And I am seventeen pages through this notebook now and there are little more than pictures of how I see you
In an X-ray machine that's more like a television screen and you're in a rut, and I know that you know what I mean
And then the realisation hits that not even two gospel choirs could save us now
Turn up on your doorstep feeling like roadkill
Tasting like postage stamps 
And when I touch you you fold up like an envelope with everything I ever wrote pouring out of your mouth

You said, "Send me stationary to make me horny", so I always write you letters in multicolours
Decorating envelopes for foreplay, damn extended metaphors, I get carried away
On the back of a natural disaster fixed with parcel tape and with kids sticking plasters
Nothing says, "I miss you" quite like war poetry you carved in your door with a Stanley knife
My year in lists
Stomping on your fingers as you're clinging on to the abyss
So put on every winter coat that you've owned since '98
And every midnight sees the countdown to another awful day
I cherish with fondness the day I met you
I cherish the day before I met you
I cherish with fondness the day before I met you

On your request, I compile a list of my top five resolutions for this year (One!)
I declined 'cause I decided that I (Two!) do not believe in the New Year anymore (Three!)
And you must confess that at times like these hopefulness is tantamount to hopelessness (Four!)
And I accept that it's time for a change, but not in places like this with people like these (Five! Five! Five! Five! Five!)
My year in lists, stomping on your fingers as you're clinging on to the abyss
So put on every winter coat that you've owned since '98 and every midnight sees the countdown to another awful day

And every sentence that I spoke began and ended in ellipses
Each of eight fingers gripping what he wrote clung on tightly, like parenthesis
And for each correctly used apostrophe I could feel my heart sink inside my chest in front of me
So, maybe the lining of a winter's coat mightn't be the best place to hide a summer secret
Said every photo that you took that festival got lost in your camera in an insurance scam
And though underexposed, I could see from the quality his K Records t-shirt and you holding his hand
And I know he took you to the beach, I can tell from how you bite on your cheek every time the sand falls from your insoles
And when our eyes meet all that I can read is, "You're the B-side"
They said, "It's not what you like, it's what you're like as a person"
Well, I need new hobbies, that's one thing for certain
"Not what you like, but what you're like as a person"; well, I need new hobbies, that's one thing for certain

I hate the stench of coffee on your breath and I hate to feel its warmth against my neck
And what right do you have to have nightmares about me, when all I wanted was to sleep?
We have to take the car 'cause the bike's on fire
We cannot trust your friends 'cause they were born liars
And if you don't exist with hearts the size of a house brick, cease and desist
I left your shallow skin and a note on your kitchen sideboard; it read, "I have left you, please never try to find me"
This is no existential crisis, just turn your pain into piety, and then set your alarm clock for 4:00am the next morning
This is how you spell "HAHAHA, I've destroyed the hopes and the dreams of a generation of faux-romantics"
And I'm pleased, I'm pleased
You walk in from your mother's balcony, panda-eyed and freezing cold
You bury yourself in my chest to warm, I notice the goosebumps on your arms, millions
And whether it's because of the numbers of hours spent laid face down on my bed listening to white noise
Or, well, obviously it's not, I somehow manage to translate them from Braille
And the trails on your skin spoke more to me than the reams and reams of half finished novels you'd leave lying all over the place
And every quotation that dribbled from your mouth like a final, fatal LiveJournal entry
I know, I am wrong, I am sorry

I was sick in my mouth because of the fear of the scent of an ex-girlfriend
And no more conversations about what Breakfast Club character you'd be
"I'd be the one that dies." "No one dies." "Well, then what's the point?"
You should have built a statue, and so I did of you, and you were ungrateful and slightly offended at the dimensions of it
You said you looked less like the Venus de Milo and more like your mother in a straitjacket
I think it's great that you're doing fine now but enough is enough and I've had enough
Since we became accelerated readers we never leave the house
You should have built a wall
And I'm not Bonnie Tyler, and I'm not Toni Braxton
And this song is not gonna save your relationship, oh, no shit
And this sentimental movie marathon has taught us one thing it's the opposite of true love is as follows: reality
You should have built a wall, not a bridge

The beats, yeah, they were coming out the speakers and were winding up straight in your sneakers
And I'm dancing like every song he spins is Bis or like all my dance heroes would if they exist
And yeah, it's sad that you think that we're all just scenesters and even if we were, it's not the scene you're thinking of
Just taking props from '90s boy band fashions, all crop tops and testosterone passion
If there's one thing I could never confess it's that I can't dance a single step
Not sure if you mind if I dance with you, but I don't think right now that you care about anything at all
And if only there were clothes on the floor I'd feel for certain I was bedroom dancing
And it's all flailing limbs at the front line, every single one of us is twisted by design
And dispatches from the back of my mind say, "So long as we're here, everything is alright"
It's you, it's me, and there's dancing
And I always get confused, because in supermarkets, they turn the lights off when they want you to leave
Because in supermarkets, they turn the lights off when they want you to leave, but in discos, they turn them on
And it's always sad to go, but it's never that sad because there's only so many places you're guaranteed of getting a hug when you leave
And then on the way home, it always seems like a good idea to go paddling in the fountain, and that's because it is a good idea
And we're just like how Rousseau depicts man in the state of nature: we're undeveloped, we're ignorant, we're stupid, but we're happy

It's bad enough you ever used the word as an adjective, but to suggest we do it in heels is really quite crass
And frankly, we're reasonably practical and we know the benefits of always doing these things in flats
And I spent the last seven years perched on the edge of my bed scratching, "I am incredibly sincere" into my forearm
You should know better
A fifteen-year-old's a notorious lazy innuendo, the last man standing is a girl
Four sweaty boys with guitars tell me nothing about my life
And the earth's air pressure gets far greater when I hear you
You should try harder
It takes an educated guess to see I like you a little at best
And if you've come here for the faces then you leave under duress
And you still treat it like a novelty, less pop concert, more butchery
And we exhale, and roll our eyes in unison
And we exhale, and we roll our eyes, and we do these things in unison
And woe is me and woe is you, and woe is us, together

When the smaller picture is the same as the bigger picture you know that you're fucked
When you're trading paper cuts for splinters you're out of luck
Like sharks don't sleep and I don't take my eyes off you
The architecture's shit and my cheeks are all ruddy and bruised
And it hits as hard as a blow to the head, or a smash to the skull, or a knee to your chest
And sweet dreams, sweet cheeks
Oh, tomorrow, oh, tomorrow, oh, tomorrow
All these mercy killings have got my conscience spinning over
We've paid off the judges and we're taking advantage
And the building's ornate but it's lacking in soul and character
Pleading our defense in binary and smiley apology montage
We're burning five story buildings laying man traps at the fire exits
Like dignity is equal to desperation and self-effacement
Playing feedback over Tannoy systems, you look desperate, you look pathetic
We're holding on to our own grandeur with careful compliment placement
And it hits as hard as a blow to the head (trading paper cuts for splinters)
Or a smash to the skull, or a knee to your chest
It hits as hard as a blow to the head, or a smash to the skull, or a knee to your chest
One blink for "Yes", two blinks for "No", sweet dreams, sweet cheeks, we leave alone

Me, in your back garden, with my Walkman tucked inside my forearm
And I'm waiting, waiting for C90, in the summer of 2007
The summer that punk rock broke my heart

When you play pass the parcel with human body parts somebody might get head, but someone will get hurt
And I'll sing what you like, if you shout it straight back at me
Thereâs red stains all over the place but they're not blood, they're cherryade
We throw parties, you throw knives, it's all the same if the fizzy drinks are nice
And it's great that you care so much about things but you left talcum powder all over the bathroom
And yeah, it is great, you can blow her smoke rings but you won't taste her lips if you do get to kiss her
And it's your party, but I'll die if I want to, I'll die if I want to
The music was okay, but the fresh air was better
And I couldn't tell if the singer's keyboard was a crutch or a synthesizer 
But it sounded like he'd broken a limb each and every time he pushed the key down or in
